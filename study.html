  <h1 class = upper>~Welcome to the Academy of Arcane Arts~</h1>

  <h2 class = quint><br><u>THE THREE PRINCIPLES OF ARCANERY</u></h2>

  <p>
      1. Spellcasting is like traversing through a thick forest.  At first, there is no path and you have to make one.  After, the more you tread on this path, the clearer it becomes.
  </p>
  <p>
      2. Arcanery consumes energy through focus.  The sharper and stronger your mind grows, the less energy you will expend. With practice, your ability to concentrate will improve, allowing you to cast spells of a more complex nature.
  </p>
  <p>
      3. Expanding on the natural tendencies of your element in a controlled manner is the path to mastery.
  </p>

  <p>
      <br>Every warlock can cast standard spells and elemental spells.  The types of elemental spells one can cast depends on their chosen element: fire, water, earth, lightning, air, ice, healing, and necromancy.  A select few individuals can be inclined to dual, or even multiple, elements.  Your current element is water.<br><br>
  
      Every degree has 3 standard spells and one elemental spell.  Provided that you can stay on top of your studies and prevent "hitting your ceiling," you can learn your first 10 degrees here at the Academy.<br><br>
  
      Before attending your classes, take a moment to practice your concentration here.  Focus on this spot and make the bubble expand.

  </div>

  <p>Your directed focus will let you control the environment around you.  Apply that focus well both inside and outside of class.</p>
