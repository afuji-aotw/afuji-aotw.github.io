time spent on stuff:
- 1 class period to add text for index.html and attempt bubble
- 40 min: give up on bubble having multiple html elements, focused on centering it and expanding it well
    - coloring
    - link on expansion: https://jsfiddle.net/xcWge/14/
    - concluding text
    - first anchor element
