          I have a really funny connection to this article, and the timing is actually quite impeccable.<br> 
      
          Since about 2013, I've been watching a genre of youtube videos known as "Minecraft Youtube," which is essentially people playing minecraft.  About 2 years ago, I discovered Hermitcraft, group of 27 that play on a minecraft server together.  Each world/server they create constitutes a new "season," with a single season running for a little bit more than a year or a little bit less than two years. <br><br>
          
          With 27 people on a single sandbox world, there is a lot going on.  Some of them do mega-builds, or craft new machines or contraptions using redstone (which is a system that is Turing-complete).  Three of them this year decided to create a "postal system" so that hermits (the term used to refer to members of Hermitcraft) could send fun little message, or advertisements, or gifts.  <br><br>
          
          
          My point is - it's an entirely not-needed system given the existing alternatives that do not take much set-up and execution time, but it was created anyway.  It was an immediate hit because it added a new way to connect with the other hermits, and it added a level of immersion to the gameplay.  Hermitcraft, a world they bring to life with their narrative-filled builds and contraptions, just got a little bit more "realistic." <br>  <br> 
          
          I've seen it be used in a variety of ways (though I do not have the time to stay caught up on the progress of all twenty-seven hermits).  One hermit sent his best friend a single potato (as an inside joke because a potato was used to break the friend's very complicated redstone machine a few years back).  Two hermits are in an "advertisement war" where they keep sending the same box of purpur blocks back and forth.  Sometimes, little patterns would be drawn using the items put in the box to add visual appeal.  Sometimes they would add a message by either writing a book and adding the book to the box, or they would rename the item itself.   <br>  <br> 
          
          If I were to connect it to the reading, I was considering what is the medium, and what is the support?  The medium would be the words if books were used or items were renamed, and the items themselves would be medium (I would argue that it's the items rather than the image of the items that are the medium, but I can also see an argument against that).  Would the box holding the items be part of the medium?  Sometimes the box's name is changed to add meaning to the message, though it's not always the case.  The stamp used to indicate the recipient would be part of the structure, as would the mailing system itself.  But there's another level of abstraction of the structure: the fact that this entire system is hosted on Minecraft - Minecraft itself is part of the structure, or a structure that holds the structure that is the mailing system. <br>  <br> 
          
          (I only remembered just now that this response should only be 3-5 sentences, but I wish also to talk more about this mailing system as there is much detail I have left out) <br>  <br> 
          
          Questions: <br>   
          
          1. Is mail art considered more of a performance art than a non-process art? <br> 
          2. If the hermits were to get more intentional with their messages and try to create mail art, would the viewers be part of the art process?  What role would they play?  Or are they only witness to the art post-creation?

        The way they talk about the web of ideas reminds me of the concept of divergent thinking, which is only a term I learned because of my ADHD diagnosis because it's a skill that a lot of ADHDers naturally have.  However, some of the techniques the text discusses seems diametrically opposed to the concept of monotropism, which I learned of from my autism diagnosis.  Monotropism is the idea that a person can focus only on a few (or just one) thing at a time but will focus very deeply on that one thing (the opposite is polytropism, the ability to evenly spread out your focus to encompass multiple things).  Reading two books at once sounds like a lot of task switching which is cognitively taxing for me.  But I wonder if task switching is a skill that can be developed through the techniques the author suggests. <br><br>

        Very interesting to think of our ability to interpret the world through metaphors as a "sixth sense."  Metaphors can be an interface, in that way.<br><br>

        <bf>Questions:<br>

        1. Poetry is the melding of form and meaning.  In what ways are websites (and also this article) poetry?  Does it count as poetry?  Or is it something else?<br>
        2. What is the difference between the author role and the architect role (that one adopts when creating a website)?

        This reminds me somewhat of caard, a website that people customize to tell the viewers about themselves and their interests.  This website is usually linked in their twitter or instagram bio - though I see it less often now (perhaps I interact with a different population of users, or it got phased out for revealing info they considered private).  someone's caard is only intended to be viewed by someone who follows that user and thus wants to get to know them, not be readily available when they post a hot take and a bunch of haters check out their bio to find personal details to weaponize. <br><br>

        Questions:<br>
        1. what makes these framesets cringey or amateur or incorrectly used?<br>

        2. in a web of connectivity, it's quite interesting to bear witness to the most unused or personal sites, like the personal websites on Geocities that have "sorry no longer working on this webpage" messages.  What is the most obscure website you have visited (in your opinion, you don't need the numbers to back this statement up)  How might the culture of internet change to make them more easily accessible?

        I've researched Autism a lot, and one way autistic brains differ from allistic (nonautistic) brains is that autistic brains tend to perform "bottom up" processing instead of "top down" processing - which means it takes them more time to see the overall picture but they are quicker to identify small details.  It also makes them on average less susceptible to falling for illusions, like the line length with arrows problem.  But one difference in this trend is the idea of "gestalt language processing" - a trait that some autistic people have.  Allistic babies when exposed to language can split sentences and phrases into words and can map which sounds go together more often than other sounds (those usually form words).  This is clumsily written, but it was one of the theories presented in my intro to cog sci class.  They learn to speak individual words before stringing phrases together.  Autistic children who experience gestalt processing will encode the entire phrase in their memory with the associated event/context.  They may learn to speak earlier or later than what is considered "normal."  Gestalt language processors would not have a "first word" - they begin by speaking entire phrases to communicate.  There is a specific group of SLPs (speech language practitioner) that specialize in speech therapy for gestalt speakers.  <br><br>

        Questions:<br>
        1. What does the brightness score mean?<br>

        2. how small do individual items (or the space between them) have to be for us to start naturally grouping them together?  How large could they get before it seems uncomfortable to see them as a group before the individual pieces?  Can you replicate this with other senses (besides hearing)?<br>

        I wish there was a way to access qr codes when the qr code is being displayed on your phone.  I don't have a second phone to scan this qr code!  too often there is no hyperlink accompanying a qr code. <br><br>
        qr codes at the end of books to provide addendums or additonal information that comes post-publication is really cool.  i've been seeing it more and more recently in books on neurodivergence - they have appendices and in that appendix there's a link to additional resources, especially worksheets in pdf form that the user can fill out digitally or print multiple copies of<br><br>
        while it's not legal to publish/sell, there's been instances of people printing and binding their favorite fanfiction or derivative works - while this is still a process that has a definitive ending, I think it's the closest that people come to "portable printing" post-publication.  I would love for there to be portable printers but it would probably be very expensive (ink and paper) and they could make printers out of proprietary tech (thus preventing diy modifications or repairs and increasing reliance on the company that sells the product).<br><br>

        Questions:<br>

        1. where is the line between medium and carrier?  In our first reading, is mail in mail art the medium, and the postal service the carrier?  Or is mail also part of the carrier system?<br>
        2. I'm actually quite confused as to the message of this reading as a whole.  Is it saying that the dynamism of interaction building on the content is required for it to be a proper hybridization of digital and analog?  Or is this criteria meant for a different classification?  What is considered important by the author?

      <div id="week_8_content" class="tangerine-regular"><br>
        I've seen image descriptions from some of my favorite content creators on instagram (since that is the most visible way to see a form of alt-text that I know of, since the image-description/alt text  is usually added in the caption or a pinned comment, and have already been familiar with how some of them take artistic liberty with their descriptions.  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C_WU9XrxaIz/">One example here:</a><br><br>
        
        [ID: Tiffy, unpaid author and brown skinned cutie with the big ol booty (not shown), standing in the frozen food aisle of a local grocery store. She wears black round rimmed glasses, pink shirt, and a gray mask. Tiffy is looking at the camera and can only afford to have one eye be fully open (her left) cause…unpaid author. Some will say it's genetics, they would be wrong.] <br><br>
        
        and while it's good to see other people modeling how to use image descriptions, having a manual or explicit guide is helpful because alt-text specifically encoded as medata is not immediately visible without technology capable of extracting it.  For example, one thing I would not be as aware about is the value of word-economy in alt-text, which is useful to know as someone who tends to over-elaborate and focus on details before the big picture.  <br><br>
        
        The exercise is something I wish to do (and may complete later here), as it touches on something I struggled with for at least a decade now: the subjectivity of narration and interpretation post-narration.  In fourth grade, I was placed in a "speech" or "public speaking" camp to improve on my confidence and oration skills.  I don't remember the exact exercise, but there was something that caused about it that caused me to disengage entirely from it- first through vocal protest and then mentally shutting down until the time period for the exercise lapsed.  I believe it was that I was trying to tell a story of something I witnessed first-hand, but the goal was to somehow influence the listener emotionally or rationally, I'm not sure.  I did what I could while still keeping the account fairly grounded in my own interpretation, but the resistance came when I received feedback that the details I was including weren't achieving the overarching goal of persuading the listener, that I had to change the story details to paint a more targeted image.<br><br> 
        
        This issue repeated itself when I had to write my common app essay in 12th grade.  I (or my parents) had decided the topic would be about my journey towards my interest in computer science.  I wrote about 10 pages detailing the steps from roughly 7th grade to 12th grade that lead me to deciding I wanted to study computer science in college.  Obviously, it wasn't going to all be included into the final draft of the essay, and I knew it.  It was only when I took painful effort to cut down on the story (but still left the tone and perspective unchanged) and received my next round of feedback that I really got stuck: my parents told me that the way I was phrasing my essay made it look like I was the recipient of these events instead of making it seem like I was " a doer."  It felt very inauthentic to write it any other way, even though I could see why they were suggesting a different narrative lens. <br><br>
        
        Before, I think I had the idea that my perspective was "the objective voice" and the changes that they were suggesting were "subjective interpretations."  However, both are technically subjective interpretations of what happened, with no single entity having an "objective record."  It's something worth thinking about, and I'm glad it was mentioned.<br><br>
        
        Questions:<br>
        1. how would the internet change if alt-text was visible by default?  Or if alt-text were displayed like title (on hover)?  Would it provide more modeling for users to learn how to write alt-text (and maybe make them curious as to why the text is there)?<br>
        
        2. has anyone here used a screen reader before?  What is your experience?  (I've personally used screen readers to turn kindle books into audio books on the ipad/iphone, and i'm curious if there are other users/use cases than described in the reading)

        The introductory story is compelling, but only yesterday did I develop a stronger connection with it.  That was when I met with the spring semester professors of Penn's operating systems (OS) class to discuss the possibility of adding embedded ethics modules into the course to introduce critical thinking of the topics covered in class.  Prior to this meeting, I spent about 2 hours googling and trying to find potential ethics topics related to OS with little luck - the only relevant content I found was Stanford's embedded ethics module positioned in their own OS course.  Thus, I asked Travis and Joel (the professors) if they had any ideas.  Both of them went into depth on the concept of trust and how many developers "trust" the tech they are building on top of because it's more efficient (faster).  How Windows and Mac both nearly have monopolies over OS tech, and the relationship then with Linux, an open source OS.  The concept of tech stacking on each other really connected in the passage when the narrator describes "pulling back the layers" and showing programs implemented in Python and a UNIX terminal with POSIX interactions - technology that is English-based and thus breaks the concept of "localization."  Very cool way to show that globalization of technology cannot easily be implemented (at least when we define globalization as allowing all linguistic diversity of involved parties to contribute to the language and development of infrastructure) - it's not as simple as transliterating key programming terms or even coming up with a new programming language that does not center English-based logic and syntax (which the third and second story also cover) <br><br>

        Now having finished the reading (I often write reflections as I read), this reading was absolutely incredible.  While the topics it covers are not brand new to me, it goes into incredible detail and even touches on personal perspective of a native Arabic speaker.  I hope that I would be able to access the entire book at some point.  <br><br>

        Questions: <br>
        1. what is localization?  they talk about it in the beginning and then don't define it though it seems like an important concept in design <br>
        2. The discussion of globalization and foreign influence is something I remember from my 10th grade Geography class.  Being a CS major, I have not taken many humanities classes in university, and it makes me wonder if this type of English-prioritized influence of technology is discussed in classes held by the college.  It sure isn't in CS classes, which is upsetting.

        overall, i felt like I was only skimming the surface of understanding.  It seems like there were many topics but also at the same time each one was being punctured with the depth of nuance that the author went into.  Concluding this reading, I'm only left with impressions that I'm sure will fade in a relatively short period of time.  I was interested in the connection to the common and also political resistance, as well as the concept of fracturing the image (into the head or the hand).<br><br>

        For the first half of the reading, I was struggling to imagine what the String Game was supposed to look like from the performer's perspective, the director's perspective, or the audience's perspective.  I even searched on youtube for a video of Vera Frenkel's string game to no avail.  The accumulation and subsequent loss of information is something I actually think about regularly.  We're told that things on the internet last forever once you post them, that nothing is "truly gone" even if you choose to delete it (this is usually a message aimed at children and young teens about forethought on posting content to the internet).  Which, in the scope of communication the comparison has merit - it's a lot harder to pull up records of a verbal conversation you've had (unless you've made a digital record), and substantive written communication is not easy to come by.  But the internet is not as stalwart as the paradigm gives it credit for - servers can crash and data can be corrupted.  We've experienced the internet archive being hacked, there are dedicated subreddits for converting content into downloadable formats to store locally, and this conversation is becoming increasingly more relevant with the prevalence of streaming services and subscription-based services.  Many people have raised the point that you do not pay money for the media itself, but rather access to a service that has the media, for now.  A couple of weeks ago, Netflix announced that Voltron Legendary Defenders is leaving within the next 2 months.  This wouldn't seem like surprising news, except for the fact that VLD is a Netflix special, which made many think that it would be exempt from the fates of many other TV series (alas, it's also Dreamworks property, and their license of 6 years is expiring).  Netflix apps and Kindle devices were popular because many things could be held in a single device, thus reducing the "physical load."  And now I think there is rising awareness that the convenience of physical minimalism has a cost.  This is not even about the ephemerality of public memory, where internet controversies can be conveniently forgotten within days if not 6 months max, despite records of contentious conversation on twitter, tiktok, instagram, and youtube allegedly keep record "forever" (though searching algorithms might convince you otherwise, as it's mighty difficult to access past discussions from more than a year ago without a good memory for specific quotes).<br><br>

        The fact that i was reading this on a digital surface which enabled me to smoothly scroll (creating a smooth feed/stream) really added to the meaning behind the discussion on different surfaces and the interpretation of direction, flow, pace, etc. of information.  Attempting to map space over time on a medium that abstracts/obfuscates both to an extent is very interesting.

        This was a really cool reading - I've been struggling to find resources on less-told stories about computer science especially centering ethical values.  Eventually got sent <a href="https://criticallyconsciouscomputing.org/">this textbook</a> which has been great, and one thing I started looking into was the history of women's involvement being the first programmers and also the first operating system tasked with the responsibility of program scheduling, memory management, and I/O.  Programming and being the OS was tedious work, so it was mostly considered a "woman's job" and a "Black woman's job."  The switch only happened when there became economic incentive to automate tasks handled by the human OS by preloading programs that eventually became the operating systems, which enabled personal computers to become commercially viable.  Due to this automation, programming was seen as more cerebral, and Hollywood + advertisements strengthened the association of computers with masculinity.  This part of history, even the fact that women used to dominate within the programming sphere, is seldom talked about, and was even missing from Cornell's slides on "a short history of the OS" from their history of computing class (a class that Penn's own CIS department lacks).  Google's SEO / page rank algorithm was really working against me for a while until i was able to get some recommended readings which gave me searchable terms (kind of like how I probably wouldn't have been able to learn about COINTELPRO if I didn't encounter its name in the reading and then got curious and searched for its wikipedia page).  <br><br>

        2. If efficiency is not the most prioritized value in our programming development environment, what other values could take its place?  How would the CS landscape change?

        this approach of "real" and "fiction" is done in a way I haven't seen before, though I've seen parallels (i.e. "this is not a pipe" painting).  <br><br>

        I was also reminded of Grey's story about the assessment "why is this art?" and their answer being very long with typical justification, while the person next to them got an A with "because someone said so... and others agreed" in the discussion about Catholic versus Protestant theories of selection.<br><br>

        The topic of local and global (and the directionality of that flow being reversed in the Internet) is particularly interesting as I was scrolling twitter the other day and saw a woman post a selfie with her newly-published PhD with a witty pun in her caption, only for millions of people to see it and thousands to send hate her way for things like "wasting taxpayer money" and "writing about something useless/nonacademic."  She joked that she would be the subject of conversation with her colleagues the next few days, an example of global to local influence.  But this type of random spotlight is quite jarring if she did not anticipate this kind of blowup online.<br><br>

        On the surveillance gaze, i can see how readings build off of each other (the one about posting turning into an infinite feed)<br><br>

        Questions:  <br>
        1. What does the author mean when he says, "Thus, the Internet leads to the globalization of the author, of the person of the author. Here I mean again not the fictional, authorial subject allegedly investing rhe artwork with his intentions and meanings, to be hermeneutically deciphered and revealed. This authorial subject has already been deconstrucred and proclaimed dead many times"
